# Angular 17 Labs

This is a Git repository for exploring and testing the new features of Angular 17, NgRx, and Nx.

## Commands

- Create Nx Workspace `nxp create-nx-workspace@latest`

```
  âˆš Where would you like to create your workspace? Â· angular-17-labs
  âˆš Which stack do you want to use? Â· none
  âˆš Package-based monorepo, integrated monorepo, or standalone project? Â· integrated
  âˆš Set up CI with caching, distribution and test deflaking Â· skip
  âˆš Would you like remote caching to make your build faster? Â· skip
```

- Add Angular plugin `nx add @nx/angular`
- Add NestJs plugin `nx add @nx/nest`
- Create the Angular App, using esbuild

  ```
  npx nx generate @nx/angular:application --name=angular-17 --bundler=esbuild --directory=apps/angular-17 --addTailwind=true --prefix=labs --projectNameAndRootFormat=as-provided --tags=type:app --no-interactive
  ```

  - `npx nx generate`: Invokes Nx to generate something within the workspace.
  - `@nx/angular:application`: Specifies the generator to use. In this case, it's for creating an Angular application.
  - `--name=angular-17`: Sets the name of the application to "angular-17".
  - `--bundler=esbuild`: Specifies the bundler to use. Here, it's set to "esbuild", which is a fast JavaScript bundler.
  - `--directory=apps/angular-17`: Specifies the directory where the application will be created. In this case, it's "apps/angular-17".
  - `--addTailwind=true`: Adds Tailwind CSS to the generated application. Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework.
  - `--prefix=labs`: Sets the prefix to be used for the generated Angular components. For example, if you generate a component named "my-component", it will have a selector like `<labs-my-component>`.
  - `--projectNameAndRootFormat=as-provided`: Specifies the format for naming the project and root. In this case, it keeps the provided format.
  - `--tags=type:app`: Assigns tags to the generated application. In this case, it adds the tag "type:app".
  - `--no-interactive`: Disables interactive mode, meaning the command won't prompt for user input.
